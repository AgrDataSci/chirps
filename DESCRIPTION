Description: API Client for the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation
  with Station Data 'CHIRPS'. The 'CHIRPS' data is a 35+ year quasi-global
  rainfall data set, which incorporates 0.05 arc-degrees resolution satellite
  imagery, and in-situ station data to create gridded rainfall time series for
  trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring. For more details on 'CHIRPS'
  data please visit its official home page <https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps>.
  Requests from large time series (> 10 years) and large geographic coverage 
  (global scale) may take several minutes.
