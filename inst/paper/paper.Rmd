# Summary

The **chirps** package provides functionalities for reproducible analysis using the CHIRPS data[@Funk2015]. CHIRPS is daily precipitation data set developed by the Climate Hazards Group[@Funk2015] for high resolution precipitation gridded data. Spanning 50°S-50°N (and all longitudes) and ranging from 1981 to near-present, CHIRPS incorporates 0.05 arc-degree resolution satellite imagery, and in-situ station data to create gridded precipitation time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring[@Funk2015]. Other functionalities of **chirps** are the computation of precipitation indices and the evaporative stress index (ESI) which describes temporal anomalies in evapotranspiration produced weekly at 0.25 arc-degree resolution for the entire globe.
