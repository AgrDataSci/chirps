# Summary

The **chirps** package [@chirps] provides functionalities for reproducible analysis using the CHIRPS data [@Funk2015]. CHIRPS is a daily precipitation data set developed by the Climate Hazards Group [@Funk2015] for high resolution precipitation gridded data. Spanning 50°S - 50°N (and all longitudes) and ranging from 1981 to near-present (normally with a 45 day lag), CHIRPS incorporates 0.05 arc-degree resolution satellite imagery, and in-situ station data to create gridded precipitation time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring [@Funk2015]. Other functionalities of **chirps** are the computation of precipitation indices, the retrieval of the evaporative stress index (ESI) which describes temporal anomalies in evapotranspiration produced weekly at 0.25 arc-degree resolution for the entire globe, and the retrieval of IMERG data which provides near-real time global observations of rainfall at 0.5 arc-degree resolution.

# Usage

The *Tapajós* National Forest is a protected area in the Brazilian Amazon. Located within the coordinates -55.4° and -54.8°E and -4.1° and -2.7°S with ~527,400 ha of multiple Amazonian ecosystems. We take three random points across its area to get the precipitation from Jan-2013 to Dec-2018 using `get_chirps.sf()` for objects of class 'sf' [@sf].
